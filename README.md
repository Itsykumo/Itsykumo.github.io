## Getting Started
Install Jekyll and Bundler gems on the development machine through RubyGems.
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Install dependencies
```bash
cd itsykumo.github.io
bundle install
```

Build and serve the site on the preview server.
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

View the site at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

Refer to the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information.

## Updating the site
Instead of making changes locally and pushing to repository, changes can be introduce via [prose.io](http://prose.io). This approach lacks the preview option thou.
