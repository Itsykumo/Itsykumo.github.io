gem install jekyll bundler
```

Install dependencies
```bash
cd rasen-m.github.io
bundle install
```

Build and serve the site on the preview server.

```

Refer to the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information.

## Updating the site
Instead of making changes locally and pushing to repository, changes can be introduce via [prose.io](http://prose.io). This approach lacks the preview option thou.
